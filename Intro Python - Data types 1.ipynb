    "\n",
    "[PEP-8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/), also known as \"Python Enhancement Proposal 8\", is the style guide for writing code in Python. It was conceived to facilitate the reading and understanding of code, promoting consistency in the way Python programmers write their code. Some of the key principles of PEP-8 include using indents of four spaces, lines that do not exceed 79 characters, and the definition of functions and variables in lowercase names separated by underscores. It is highly recommended to adhere to PEP-8 to maintain clean and readable Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `import this`\n",
    "\n",
    "The command `import this` or [PEP-20](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/) in Python is a little \"easter egg\" included in the language, which when executed, displays the **\"Zen of Python\"**. The \"Zen of Python\" is a collection of 19 aphorisms that express the design philosophy of the Python language. Some of these aphorisms emphasize the importance of code readability and simplicity over complexity. You can see these aphorisms at any time while programming in Python by executing the command `import this` in your Python console or script.\n",

    "## Casting in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Type conversion, also known as \"casting,\" refers to the process of converting one data type to another. Previously, we have seen data types such as `int`, `string`, or `float`. Well, it turns out that it's possible to convert from one type to another. But first, let's look at the different types of conversions or type transformations that can be performed. There are two:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implicit conversion:** This is done automatically by Python. It occurs when we perform certain operations with two different types, Python converts it in the background without the need for the programmer to explicitly indicate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explicit conversion:** We do this explicitly, such as converting a `str` to `int` with `int()` or to `float` with `float()`. This type of conversion is done using predefined Python functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that not all data types can be safely converted between each other. For example, trying to convert a text string containing letters to an integer will result in an error. Therefore, it's always a good practice to handle potential errors using exception control structures, which we'll see later in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see some examples of each to better understand how they work!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implicit conversion\n",
    "This type of conversion is done automatically by Python, practically without us noticing. However, it's important to know what's happening under the hood to avoid future problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest example where we can see this behavior is as follows:\n",
    "- `a` is an `int`\n",
    "- `b` is a `float`\n",
    "\n",
    "But if we add `a` and `b` and store the result in `a`, we can see how Python has internally converted the `int` to `float` to perform the operation, and the resulting variable is a `float`. However, there are other cases where Python is not as smart and is unable to perform the conversion. If we try to add an `int` to a `string`, we'll get a `TypeError`."

    "It's important to anticipate potential issues in user inputs and manage them properly to avoid errors during execution. One way to do this is through defensive programming, where the validity of inputs is checked before proceeding with operations. Additionally, we can use flow control structures, such as `if/else`, and error handling with `try/except` to handle unexpected situations more elegantly.\n",
